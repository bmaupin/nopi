Abandoned attempt at a web application for creating 3DS emulation injects, similar to New Super Ultimate Injector (NSUI).

It was never the goal to match the functionality of NSUI, opting instead for a simpler approach, but still with some advantages:

- Open-source; this would allow for a community of contributors and maintainers. NSUI development has always been one person and stopped several years ago.
- Cross-platform; NSUI is Windows-only, but [with some work can run on Linux](https://gist.github.com/bmaupin/93d31e1b2d738ae656b9d3617e19622b)
- Web application; no software/framework installation needed
- Dynamic handling of ROM thumbnails; NSUI has the thumbnail source URLs hard-coded into the application, so many of them are broken
- More cores (e.g. PSP)
- Newer cores, including functionality from newer versions of RetroArch, e.g. [Retroarch just got a lot better!](https://gbatemp.net/threads/retroarch-just-got-a-lot-better.593672/)
