Abandoned attempt at a pure TypeScript implementation of a library to write 3DS CIA files from scratch.

The first approach was to write the entire CIA file from scratch using Project_CTR as a reference. This is a massive effort, and in the end this was abandoned in favour of hard-coding much of it from one of the RetroArch core CIAs and only making the necessary parts configurable.

Even that would've been a massive effort and was abandoned as well in favour of [../cia-editor/](../cia-editor/)
